Create hooks for claude to track all conversations and prompts as per assignment

## 2026-11-10T20:38:42.889Z · session `b1ff7990`

I've went through the docs and mocks here inconsistancies which I found: 

1.POST /v1/orders only takes planId, and plan IDs are the same across EE, LV and LT, while VAT isn't (24% vs 21%)
2. EE Standard says "from 10,99 €" in the CMS, but the API gives 11,15 € with VAT. 
3. Trial eligibility and the final price are only known after eID, and I think we need consent and a clear "order and pay" button before payment. I think we need some Review step here
4. LV: the API returns 2 plans, the CMS has 3 and there are 3 plans in the brief
5. "Existing subscribers go to their account": only knowable with a live session cookie or after eID. Where is the account, and is a client-side redirect from a static page acceptable? 
6. On phones the eID app switch or an in-app browser (Instagram, Facebook) can return the user in a different browser: no cookie, no selected plan, no UTM.
7. No sign-up form means no email: no receipt, no "your payment was confirmed" message, no recovery contact. `/v1/me` has no name. 
8. No logout or "not you?". What happens when the eID country differs from the site market?
9. The payment return URL and its parameters are undocumented 
10. LV entries are partly empty and there is no rule for empty fields, no fallback language, no publish validation. What do LV visitors see before launch?
11. No consent mechanism is named. GA4 and UTM storage need consent in the EU.
12. No accessibility requirement is stated
13. "Usually seconds, occasionally minutes": no polling guidance, no push channel, no rule for what the user sees after N seconds. 
14. No requirements on the locale in the url. Do we need some kind of language selector?
15. currency is returned by the mock but is not in the API notes

I want you to go through the documentation and confirm my findings. I want you to go through the docs as well and find them. Create a list from all the issues and list them from high to low priority

## 2026-11-10T20:43:38.077Z · session `b1ff7990`

Okay, here are the questions I send to the HR, which I think have the highest priority now



<pasted_content id="ccea">
1. POST /v1/orders only takes planId, and plan IDs are the same across EE, LV and LT, while VAT isn't (24% vs 21%). How does the backend know the market? From the session, or should the frontend send it? Until I hear otherwise I'm sending `market` and flagging it as a launch blocker in the spec.

2. EE Standard says "from 10,99 €" in the CMS, but the API gives 11,15 € with VAT. Which one is right? For now I'm going with the API and not rendering priceLabel.

3. Trial eligibility and the final price are only known after eID, and I think we need consent and a clear "order and pay" button before payment. Is it OK to add a Review step there, or are the three steps in the brief fixed? I've put Review behind a feature flag in the meantime, so it's easy to turn off.

Task: draft spec/02-system-context.md. One file only, do not touch others

 Context to read (and nothing else):
  - ASSIGNMENT.md: section "What to deliver", bullet 2
  - docs/01-product-brief.md, docs/02-api-notes.md, docs/03-cms-content-model.md, docs/04-analytics-notes.md
  - mock-server/README.md (to see what the mock does beyond the docs)
  - spec/03-open-questions.md (dont create new ones)


 What I already know, so check it rather than rediscover it:
- Two origins in prod: www.nordlight.example (app) and api.nordlight.example.
- Auth is a cookie set by the API, so we need credentialed CORS and the right cookie attributes. None of this is documented.
- The eID and payment providers are full-page redirects out and back. The webhook from payment to API is invisible to us.


What the file must contain:
1. A mermaid flowchart. 
2. Upstream table with system, owner, how we talk to it, what we use it for, what user sees if it fails
3. Cross origin requirements

Before writing: ask me up to 3 questions if something blocks you. Or if you think something is worth noting in this document

## 2026-11-10T21:21:00.281Z · session `0c604365`

Review spec/02-system-context.md against the sources, not against itself:
1. For every row in "Upstream", point to the line in docs/ or the mock that backs it. Mark rows you can't back.
2. Does every failure outcome match a state from state machine?

Draft spec/04-user-flow-state-machine.md. 

Read docs/02-api-notes.md, mock-server/README.md, spec/03-open-questions.md.

My sketch (check it for holes, don't replace it):

 plans → select → eID → callback (verify via /v1/me) → review → order
    → payment → return (poll) → confirmed

Failures: eID cancelled/expired/rate-limited, already subscribed,
    401, payment failed/cancelled/requires_action/slow.

Invariants (put them first):
1. One order per attempt; new order only on explicit retry after failed.
2. Trust: server > stored context > URL query.
3. Polling errors never show "payment failed".
4. Every state has an exit.

 Behaviour only: no code, no file names. Map every mock scenario to a row.
  ≤150 lines. Ask me up to 3 questions first if something is ambiguous.

## 2026-11-10T21:35:04.249Z · session `231b9a5a`

Review spec/04 without editing:
1. Walk every state: does it have an exit? List dead ends.
2. Map each scenario in mock-server/README.md to rows. List unmapped ones.
3. Try to break invariants 1 and 6: give me concrete sequences of events
   (double click, reload during order.creating, Back from payment, two tabs,
   session expiring on the payment page) and say which row handles each,
   or that none does.
4. Anything here that contradicts spec/05 (error kinds) or spec/07
   (which transition fires which analytics event)?
Findings only, ranked by how badly they'd break the flow.
